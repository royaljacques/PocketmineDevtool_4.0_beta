# PocketmineDevtool_4.0_beta
devtool patch plugin for pocketmine version 4.0 (beta version)<br>
join my server for possibilitie bug [Aetherium Shop_help_Team](https://discord.gg/vEzc4jRRbC) <br>
this is only a test version that I have patched for me in order to be able to advance on my server and be able to get ahead of the new pocketmine version. in any case it is me who created this plugin. I was just adding to him what he lacked. I hope it works with you, in any case with me it works very well
